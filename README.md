# Project Title

- MiniGrounds

# Description 

- Web application that hosts Games the user can play, the game changes based on what the user chooses to play, by clicking on the game icon

# Why?

- The three of us struggled to come up with creative ideas but all found game devlopment interesting. We wanted to consolidate our learning in different areas while   working together. This means that we can play on each other's strengths while learning from one another 

# MVP Acceptance Criteria 

- Three working games
- A website that hosts the games 

# Potential Extensions

- A website that hosts the games and should be able to save the users progress
- Deploy the website using AWS
- Implementing Stripe to enable a subscription service that allows the user to purchase premium features

# Risks

- Unable to produce any working games within the time limit
- Setting the bar to high for what we can achieve in the time scale we have

# Exclusions

- Does not need to run on a mobile app (just a web application at a fixed viewport)

# Prerequisites 

- Research into the games we are developing 

# How to Install and Run

- Fork this repo into your git hub 
- npm Install inside the Client folder (we used VSC)
- Start the React app by running npm start 
- Open the Server in Inteliji and run the file "server application" inside server/src/main/java
- once the server has started, visit http://localhost:3000 this URL hosts the React app
- That should be you ready to go, Have Fun!
